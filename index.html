        <li>""There is a site right now on face book that is called "Calling all hoes" that seems to be a place for people to write, for all the world to see, any hurtful or sick thought about anyone that they don't like-- Face Book refuses to take the page down... I don't know what to do and I feel that something needs to be done before we are hearing on the news about some poor kid who killed themselves over what's being written about them on this vile site. Help..... Anyone know how I, we, can begin the process of taking this Facebook page down?" " - 17 year-old girl from US

        <br><li>""My sixteen year old son was cyber bullied on Facebook over a period of 8 hours. The event was so traumatic it caused my son to have an acute psychotic break and to be hospitalized in an adolescent psychiatric ward for almost a month. He is changed forever and will never be the same mentally. Internet bullying can hurt and affect people and kids need to know this. These kids are not being punished in any way and think the incident is funny! We know it is life changing." " - Parent of 16 year-old boy from MN</li>

   <p id="subc">What is Cyber Bulling?</p>
   <p id="sub2">Cyberbullying is bullying with the use of digital technologies. It can take place on social media, messaging platforms, gaming platforms and mobile phones. It is repeated behaviour, aimed at scaring, angering or shaming those who are targeted. Examples include:

    spreading lies about or posting embarrassing photos or videos of someone on social media
    sending hurtful, abusive or threatening messages, images or videos via messaging platforms
    impersonating someone and sending mean messages to others on their behalf or through fake accounts..<br>Face-to-face bullying and cyberbullying can often happen alongside each other. But cyberbullying leaves a digital footprint â€“ a record that can prove useful and provide evidence to help stop the abuse.
